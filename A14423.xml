            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſame man that was apprehended did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that hee was enioyned to act this ſame
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11848:4"/>treachery, within 15. dayes, or a month at the fartheſt: So by that wee coniecture and hope that they are victualled for no longer time.</p>
            <p>The like Treachery wee heare from <hi>England</hi> was plotted there by the <hi>Agent of the King of France,</hi> but God be thanked he is yet well; and ſo I hope ſhall be to the terror of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 5. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> being Sunday in the night, we made approach into their Trenches, and beat them out moſt ſhamefully to their great loſſe: The Reaſon why wee gaue them this Allarume, was to the intent wee might get to a principall Well they haue in their cuſtody, that we might poyſon it, the which we effected to our very little hurt, and their much preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, by reaſon they haue ſo little water, the beſt of them is ſtinted to a Pint a day, the common Souldiers haue leſſe, and haue but a Biskett a day to eate with a pound of Butter between eight of them.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of their Horſes they were faine to kill for want of water, and to caſt them into the Sea: So they haue not aboue 40 Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes left in all; the which were encountered by ours the night following as they were going for reliefe to another little Fort they haue, in which are ſome two hundred men, or there about: There they haue good water enough, but very little Victuals; our Horſe men beate them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with ſome loſſe to them, and they tooke a Priſoner, whilſt wee were entring their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11848:4"/>our Sea watch had taken two Barkes, the one laden with Prouiſions, and the other had 27. Barons and great Commanders which were comming to the Fort to aſſiſt the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Monſieur <hi>Thorax;</hi> after them were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if they ſafely arriued, ſeuen thouſand men, and 3000. horſes, who were fearefull to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Commanders, and as I thinke now, will ſcarſe euer follow; for that they were all drowned, onely three were ſaued: the one of them is the Gouernour of <hi>Breſt</hi> his Sonne; the other, Gouernour of the Kings Fort by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell;</hi> the third, Lieutenant Colonell of the three Thouſand Horſe, a braue Commander.</p>
            <p>The principall that were drowned of note that theſe men will diſcouer to vs, was the baſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King of <hi>France,</hi> a great Prince: the other was Colonell of the Horſes; the reſt they will not name vnto vs, their loſſe is ſo great that they are aſhamed to ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> are fearefull that the King will lay ſiedge to the Towne, ſince hee cannot ſend them to vs: So as thoſe <hi>French</hi> that came to aſſiſt vs, being in number two hundred and fifty, they are now gone backe to <hi>Rochell</hi> for their owne defence.</p>
            <p>The King hath made Proclamation in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedocke,</hi> that thoſe Proteſtants that will not go to Maſſe by the ſixteenth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they ſhall prepare for the Sword; vpon which cauſe the Duke <hi>de Rohan,</hi> for their defence, and his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11848:5"/>owne hath fifteene thouſand men in Armes, and the Proteſtants flocke daily to him, and to <hi>Rochell</hi> for their Defence.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> for that the King hath not performed with him concerning the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Siſter, is ioyned with the <hi>Count de So ſons,</hi> a great man of <hi>France,</hi> who for ſome priuate diſcontent was of the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie againſt the King, who fledd ſome to one part, and ſome to another.</p>
            <p>One of them is in <hi>England</hi> which was vſed to come ſo much to my Lords.</p>
            <p>All of them now that are able to raiſe any force are comming with theſe two, againſt the King with a very great force and power.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hath all his Forces rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend himſelfe againſt the King, but as yet hee ſtirres not, ſo that if pleaſe GOD wee had this Fort, wee ſhould haue hope of further good ſucceſſe to follow this Enterpriſe, to the <hi>French</hi> Kings great trouble, conſidering how much he hath to doe, and with whom.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Pennington</hi> hath taken two Shipps of the <hi>French</hi> which were bound for <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our men hath alſo taken a Galley from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fort which was for the Gouernours ſafety, when hee could hold out no longer; there was no men in her, by reaſon it lay neere the Shore, they ranne away other Boates and Barques in abundance.</p>
            <p>Wee haue taken thoſe that venture to paſſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11848:5"/>by vs, and many wee haue ſuncke with men in them, ſome we haue fired vnder the Fort, ſo that now our Sea men haue nothing to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>French</hi> dare not venter to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The ninth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 7. Souldiers ranne from them to vs, and doe proteſt that they haue killed many of their Horſes for food, ſo that now there is not aboue twelue in all, which are ſtollen out into the little Fort, who were afterwards encountered by Sir <hi>William Connig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Captaine of the Horſe, with as many on foote, who were going out for forrage for their Horſes, but as they comming home, Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> mett with them, and ſlew and drowned thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of them, and fiue he tooke Priſoners, the reſt eſcaped very hardly.</p>
            <p>Such is the Cowardiſe of theſe that are left, that they haue ſuffered themſelues to be round Entrenched, and not once to make any Sally vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe (I thinke) my Lord will keepe no quarter with them, becauſe of their trecherous plott againſt his Perſon, and they being fearefull, will rather ſtarue then fight, now the beſt of them is gone, the <hi>French</hi> Nobility haue had ſuch ill ſucceſſe this many yeares.</p>
            <p>They are forſt to ſet vp Sheets in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Fort to catch Raine water to drinke,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11848:6"/>wee haue had much raine which hath beene a great helpe to them.</p>
            <p>The ninth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> here was a man hanged againſt the Fort, who had attempted with many others (women and children) to carry Victualls to their husbands, and fathers, and friends into the Port, contrary to a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there to tending.</p>
            <p>For which attempt on the cleuenth day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, all the Wiues, Children, and Families of thoſe men which were in the Fort, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the Towne into the Fort, to helpe to eat that little Prouiſion that they haue left; but had you heard the cry that was made amongſt them it would haue greened the hardeſt heart liuing: for their Husbands were forced to ſhoot againſt their Wiues, and Fathers againſt their Children, and not to ſuffer them to come in: but the night being very wett, at laſt they tooke them in with an ill will.</p>
            <p>The ſame Proclamation likewiſe ſhall bee put in execution through the whole Iſle, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is done, the ſooner wee ſhall haue done with them.</p>

            <p>We haue expected euer ſince wee came fiue thouſand men out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and three out of <hi>England,</hi> but wee heare no newes of them at all.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11848:6"/>
            <p>Wee haue not (God be thanked) any of our men ſicke, nor ill, for all that they neuer ſtirre out of their Trenches, and the weather very wett.</p>
